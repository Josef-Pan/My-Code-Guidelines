My Swift iOS Performance Guidelines
Those tips are upgraded regularly


1. UI
    * Use as less as possible on the non-opaque views
    * Do not use UIView tag unless it is really necessary
    * Do the heavy calculation of drawing in a background thread
    * UITableView/UICollectionView: use less subviews and less effects in the cell
    * UITableView/UICollectionView: cache data as stored data ( class property) if possible
    * UITableView/UICollectionView: put heavy calculation/http jobs in a background thread
    * Do not resize image in place to fit the UIViews, do it in advance if possible, especially in UITableView/UICollectionView/UIScrollView
    * The following things are not hardware accelerated, which means that they need to be done in software (offscreen):
        # Anything done in a drawRect. If your view has a drawRect, even an empty one, the drawing is not done in hardware, 
          and there is a performance penalty.
        # Any layer with the shouldRasterize property set to YES.
        # Any layer with a mask or drop shadow.
        # Text (any kind, including UILabels, CATextLayers, Core Text, etc).
        # Any drawing you do yourself (either onscreen or offscreen) using a CGContext.
    
2. Language
    * Use final or private for class methods, to avoid dynamic dispatching. (not necessary for release build)
    * Avoid using KVO if not required the API (AVPlayer would require it). KVO is always dynamic dispatching, and is dozens of times slower than closure.
    * Objective C is always dynamic dispatching, using legacy code in OBJC only if necessary.
    * Remove all print from production code, even though this is not required by Apple.
    * Array holding struct objects is much faster than array holding class, avoid array of class objects 
    * Consider use linked list instead of array if no sort or lookup is needed
    * Consider using ContiguousArray for better performance if only lookup is frequently needed
    * Use reduce, filter, map, compactMap forEach of the Collection types instead of for/while loops
    * Use named tuple for simple structs instead of struct.
      typealias RowColumn = (row: Int, col: Int)
    * Use DispatchQueue.concurrentPerform to do heavy operations on collection types, including array, dictionary etc
    
3. Algorithm and data structure
    * Always think in advance what is the right data structure and what will be the right algorithm 
    * Replace recursing functions with dynamic planning if possible, dynamic planning is much faster than recursing
    * Practise algorithm weekly or even daily
    
4. Use Xcode or 3rd-party tools for performance monitoring
    * MetricKit
    * Google Firebase performance
    * SwiftInfo
    
5. Performance Testing Checklist
    * How much of the RAM is required for utilising this app?
    * To verify the speed and response time of APP under different networks and circumstances.
    * Ensure realistic user experience under several network conditions
    * Ensure the required results are achieved in case of multiple connectivities
    * Ensure the application does not get crashed.
    * Ensuring the mobile applications perform well while using data, Wi-Fi, or other connectivity
    * Monitoring the uptime and the mobile API usage bottlenecks
    * To ensure the maximum number of simultaneous users
    * Finally, to check the mobile app to its limits
